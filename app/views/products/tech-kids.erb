        TechKids is an after school club in which kids use educational material designed for children 5 years and up
        both on virtual and physical platforms to teach computational thinking skills.
        Computer programming is the new literacy. It's just like reading and writing.

        Lately, almost every aspect of our lives is run by computers, from agriculture, government, health, business
        etc.

        For our children to succeed and thrive in this 21st Century , they are going to need to know how to read and
        write computer programs.

        Computer Programming fosters creativity, develops risk takers, encourages trial and error and imparts problem
        solving skills. These are all summed up as computational thinking skills.

        Cuurently, TechKids is operational in
