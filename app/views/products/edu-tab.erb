        The EduTab is a normal tablet PC with educational content uploaded by us to cater for your child along different
        age groups; Nursery, Lower Primary, Upper Primary and Secondary.
      </p>

      <p>

        The EduTab is meant to address the limitations of our outdated current education system, a system that doesn't
        impart essential 21st century skills of collaboration, critical thinking and communication.
      </p>

      <p>

        At the TOD Idea, we hope to use the EduTab to improve educational outcomes through focussing on the brain the
        child takes to class , a brain that is able to learn how to learn as it were.
      </p>

              NO; Our model is an OFFLINE model because most parents are not comfortable with unsanctioned access to the

              if one is streaming video. Being OFFLINE mades the EduTab safe and cost effective.
